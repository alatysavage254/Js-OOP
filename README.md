# JavaScript OOP Crash Course

This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript, using practical code examples. Each file covers a different OOP technique, building from basic to advanced patterns.

## Files Overview

- **1_basic_literals.js**: Object literals and basic object usage.
- **2_constructor.js**: Constructor functions and instantiation.
- **3_prototypes.js**: Prototypes, prototype methods, and inheritance.
- **4_inheritance.js**: Prototype inheritance with constructor functions.
- **5_object_create.js**: Prototypal inheritance using `Object.create`.
- **6_classes.js**: ES6 classes, methods, static methods, and instance methods.
- **7_subclasses.js**: ES6 class inheritance (subclasses).
- **index.html**: Loads and runs the JavaScript files in a browser.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the examples.
2. Or, run individual `.js` files with Node.js for console output.
